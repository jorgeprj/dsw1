# Web Development 1 Repository (UFSCar)
This repository contains the assignments developed by students Jorge [(jorgeprj)](https://github.com/jorgeprj) and Lucas [(LucasAbbiati)](https://github.com/LucasAbbiati) for the Web Development 1 course at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar).

## Course Assignments
The course was divided into three practical assignments (AA1, AA2, and AA3), each focusing on different web development technologies and concepts.

AA1 - Application with Java Servlets and JSP
The first assignment (AA1) consisted of developing a complete web application using Java Servlets and JSP (JavaServer Pages). The objective was to create a dynamic and interactive application using these technologies.

### AA2 - Application with SpringMVC, JPA, and AJAX
For the second assignment (AA2), the students utilized SpringMVC, JPA (Java Persistence API), and AJAX to develop an advanced web application. These technologies allowed the creation of a robust system with data persistence and asynchronous interactions.

### AA3 - Application with Spring MVC + REST API
The third assignment (AA3) covered the development of a complete application using Spring MVC in conjunction with a REST API (Application Programming Interface). This combination facilitated the creation of a web application that follows the principles of REST architecture for client-server communication.
